# POC-4: On-Premises to AWS Migration with Analytics Workloads

## Overview

This proof of concept (POC) demonstrates the migration of on-premises workloads to AWS, focusing on:

1. Decoupling and modernizing a three-tier architecture application
2. Migrating a data analytics workload from on-premises Hadoop to AWS

The solution addresses high availability concerns with the current on-premises infrastructure and leverages AWS managed services to reduce operational overhead.

## Business Context

The customer currently runs their workloads on physical servers in an on-premises data center. They face reliability challenges, including potential complete system outages during power failures. They want to migrate to AWS to improve reliability, scalability, and take advantage of managed services.

## Current Architecture

### Three-Tier Web Application
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Apache Web Server with Java application
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Access**: Accepts user traffic from the internet

### Data Analytics Workload
- **Processing**: Apache Hadoop
- **Data Storage**: On-premises storage
- **Visualization**: Unspecified visualization tools

## Migration Strategy

This solution uses a hybrid migration approach that combines lift-and-shift with cloud-native enhancements. The web application will be lifted and shifted with strategic improvements, while the data analytics workload will be re-platformed from on-premises Hadoop to AWS EMR with additional managed services.

## Detailed AWS Architecture

### Three-Tier Web Application

#### Frontend Layer
- **Amazon S3**: Host static content (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- **Amazon CloudFront**: Content delivery network for low-latency global distribution
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated deployment process for pushing new builds to S3 and invalidating CloudFront cache

#### Application Layer
- **EC2 Instances**: Lift and shift the Java backend to run on EC2 server instances
- **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)**: Distribute traffic across multiple instances and Availability Zones
- **Auto Scaling Groups**: Automatically adjust capacity based on demand and replace unhealthy instances
- **Future Consideration**: Refactoring to AWS Lambda or ECS/EKS Fargate for serverless compute or container orchestration

#### Database Layer
- **Amazon Aurora**: MySQL-compatible database with 5x the throughput of standard MySQL
  - Requires minimal to no refactoring of application code
  - Multi-AZ deployment for automatic failover and high availability
  - Read replicas for read scaling and disaster recovery in other regions
- **AWS Database Migration Service (DMS)**: Migrate initial data from on-premises to the cloud

### Data Analytics Architecture

#### Data Processing
- **Amazon EMR**: Managed Hadoop framework for processing vast amounts of data
  - Migration path for existing Apache Hadoop jobs/scripts

#### Data Ingestion
- **AWS Glue**: Managed serverless ETL service for batch/scheduled jobs
  - Recommended for daily ingestion of large historical datasets
- **Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose**: Near real-time data streaming service
  - Recommended for streaming logs, transaction data that needs to be quickly available in S3

#### Data Storage
- **Amazon S3**: Primary storage for the data lake
  - Different storage classes (Standard, Intelligent-Tiering, Glacier) based on access patterns
  - **AWS Lake Formation** for data governance and simplified access management

#### Data Analysis and Visualization
- **Amazon Athena**: Query data directly in S3 using standard SQL without loading it into a database
- **Amazon QuickSight**: Managed business intelligence service for visualization

### Initial Bulk Data Migration
- **AWS DataSync**: Optimized for large-scale, secure, and efficient transfers between on-premises storage and AWS
- **Alternative 1**: AWS Snowball family for very large datasets or limited network bandwidth
- **Alternative 2**: AWS Direct Connect/VPN for secure high-bandwidth ongoing data transfer

### Networking Components
- **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)**: Isolated network environment for all AWS resources
- **Subnets**: Private subnets for app servers and databases, public subnets for load balancers and NAT gateways
- **Security Groups and Network ACLs**: Firewall rules to control traffic
- **Internet Gateway**: For public subnet resources to access the internet
- **NAT Gateway**: For private subnet resources to access the internet without being publicly accessible
- **VPN Connection/Direct Connect**: Secure connectivity between on-premises data center and AWS

### Additional Security Components
- **AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management)**: Define roles and policies following the principle of least privilege
- **Data Encryption**: At rest (S3, RDS, EMR) and in transit (SSL/TLS)
- **AWS KMS (Key Management Service)**: Centralized key management
- **AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall) & AWS Shield**: Protection against common web exploits and DDoS attacks

### Monitoring and Logging
- **Amazon CloudWatch**: Collect metrics, logs, and set alarms
- **AWS CloudTrail**: Audit API calls and user activity

### Management & Governance
- **AWS Systems Manager**: Operational tasks like patching, running commands, and managing instances
- **AWS Config**: Assess, audit, and evaluate resource configurations
- If the customer is a large enterprise, discuss setting up a multi-account strategy for better isolation and governance in **AWS Organizations**.

### Cost Management
- **AWS Budgets**: Set up budgets to monitor and control AWS costs
- **AWS Cost Explorer**: Analyze cost trends and optimize expenses

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup
- Create VPC with appropriate subnets, security groups, and routing
- Set up IAM roles and permissions
- Establish connectivity between AWS and on-premises for hybrid operations

### Phase 2: Web Application Migration
- Migrate static content to S3 and configure CloudFront
- Deploy Java application on EC2 with Auto Scaling and ELB
- Set up Aurora database and migrate data using DMS
- Configure monitoring and security controls

### Phase 3: Analytics Workload Migration
- Set up EMR cluster and configure Hadoop jobs
- Implement data ingestion pipelines with Glue and/or Kinesis
- Migrate data to S3 using DataSync or Snowball
- Configure Athena for SQL queries and QuickSight for visualization

### Phase 4: Testing and Optimization
- Validate functionality and performance
- Optimize for cost using appropriate instance types and S3 storage classes
- Implement Reserved Instances or Savings Plans for predictable workloads
- Fine-tune auto-scaling policies

## Benefits of the AWS Solution

1. **High Availability**: Multi-AZ deployment eliminates single points of failure
2. **Scalability**: Auto-scaling capabilities to handle varying loads
3. **Managed Services**: Reduced operational overhead with AWS managed services
4. **Cost Optimization**: Pay-as-you-go pricing model with reserved instances for predictable workloads
5. **Security**: Enhanced security with AWS security services and best practices
6. **Performance**: Global content delivery and optimized database performance

## Next Steps

1. Create detailed architecture diagram using AWS architecture icons
2. Develop CloudFormation templates for infrastructure deployment
3. Create migration runbooks for each component
4. Develop testing strategy for validating the migrated workloads
