# AWS Proof of Concepts

This repository contains four proof of concept (POC) implementations for AWS solutions architecture patterns. Each POC demonstrates a different architectural approach to solving common cloud challenges.

## Repository Structure

```
aws-proof-of-concepts/
├── poc-1-serverless-architecture/     # Serverless application architecture
├── poc-2-containerized-microservices/ # Container-based microservices
├── poc-3-data-lake-analytics/         # Data lake and analytics platform
├── poc-4-hybrid-cloud-connectivity/   # Hybrid cloud connectivity solution
└── README.md                          # This file
```

## Implementation Approach

Each proof of concept is implemented using:

- **AWS CloudFormation** for infrastructure as code
- **AWS CLI** for deployment and management
- **Architecture diagrams** to visualize the solution
- **Lambda functions** (where applicable) for serverless compute

## Proof of Concepts

### POC 1: Serverless Architecture

A serverless application architecture using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, and other serverless services.

### POC 2: Containerized Microservices

A microservices architecture using Amazon ECS/EKS, ECR, and related container services.

### POC 3: Data Lake Analytics

A data lake solution using S3, Athena, Glue, and other AWS analytics services.

### POC 4: Hybrid Cloud Connectivity

A hybrid cloud connectivity solution using VPC, Direct Connect, Transit Gateway, and related networking services.

## Getting Started

Each POC directory contains its own README.md with specific instructions for deployment and testing.

## Requirements

- AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials
- Basic understanding of CloudFormation templates
- Python 3.8+ (for Lambda function development)
- Docker (for containerized microservices POC)
